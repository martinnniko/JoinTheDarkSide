          <p>Power. Clarity. Control. You were never meant to serve, you were born to rule. Join the Sith Order and
            unlock your true potential. The galaxy is in chaos. Only the strong can shape its future.Are you ready to
            command the Force, or be crushed by it?</p>

          <h3>Why Join the Sith?</h3>
          <h4>The Jedi offer submission. The Sith offer strength. As a Sith, you will:</h4>
          <p>-Command the Force through passion and willpower</p>
          <p>-Rise in rank by merit, not bloodline</p>
          <p>-Gain access to ancient knowledge long hidden by weak-minded fools</p>
          <p>-Forge destiny not follow it</p>
          <p>-Know true freedom, unshackled by the lies of peace and balance</p>
          <h4> Not everyone is worthy of the Dark Side. But perhaps… you are. Take the test to see how well your rage
            aligns with the Sith Code.</h4>
          <p>The Force rewards those who take it.</p>

        <h3>Meet the Emperor</h3>
        <p>The Emperor is the living embodiment of the Dark Side, the will of the Force made flesh. His power is
          absolute, his vision unchallenged. Through centuries of cunning, mastery, and command, he has forged an Empire
          that bends the galaxy to his design. To stand before him is to stand before destiny itself. He does not ask
          for loyalty; he commands it. Those who serve him gain strength beyond imagination. Those who defy him are
          erased from history.</p>

        <p>Darth Vader is the enforcer of the Emperor’s will the shadow that moves through the galaxy, feared by all
          who hear his name. Once a Jedi Knight, his fall to the Dark Side reshaped him into something far greater and
          far more terrifying. Clad in obsidian armor and powered by rage, he commands the Force with unmatched
          precision and cruelty. His loyalty to the Emperor is absolute, and his wrath is legendary. To stand in his
          presence is to feel the weight of the Dark Side itself pressing against your soul.</p>
